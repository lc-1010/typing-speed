# Typing Speed Tester

A configurable TUI typing speed tester with performance metrics and graph.

To make practice interesting, the current trending topics on Wikipedia can be used as test sentences. Alternatively, a list of the 1000 most common words can be used instead. Punctuation, capitalisation and digits are optional.

Built using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) by Charm.
